<h1>Superhero</h1>
<p>
    A superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural
    or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains.
    A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although the word
    superhero is commonly used for females also. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters,
    especially in American comic books since the 1930s. By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman
    powers or phenomena to be deemed <strong>superhero</strong>.[1][2][3] While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero"
    is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting
    evil or crime",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary
    or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters,
    costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be
    explicitly referred to as <strong>superhero</strong> but nevertheless share similar traits. Some <strong>superhero</strong>    use their powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains, who are their
    criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy. Some long-running
    <strong>superhero</strong> such as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the Flash,
    Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
    Early history[edit] The word 'superhero' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes
    as Robin Hood, who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized
    the idea of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed
    pulp fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began
    appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character Popeye
    (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8] In the 1930s, both trends came together in some
    of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10] (visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai
    oral storytellers in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the Magician[11][12][13] (1934), Superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel
    (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books. 1940s[edit] Fox Feature Syndicate's 1930s–1940s superhero the
    Flame During the 1940s there were many <strong>superhero</strong>: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted
    in this era. This era saw the debut of first known female superhero, writer-artist Fletcher Hanks's character Fantomah,
    an ageless ancient Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers
    to fight evil; she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous "Barclay Flagg".[14][15]
    The Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs using the superpower of
    invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated newspaper comic strip a few months later
    on June 3, 1940.[16] One superpowered character was portrayed as an antiheroine, a rarity for its time: the Black Widow,
    a costumed emissary of Satan who killed evildoers in order to send them to Hell — debuted in Mystic Comics #4 (Aug. 1940),
    from Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Most of the other female costumed crime-fighters during this
    era lacked superpowers. Notable characters include The Woman in Red,[17][18] introduced in Standard Comics' Thrilling
    Comics #2 (March 1940); Lady Luck, debuting in the Sunday-newspaper comic-book insert The Spirit Section June 2, 1940;
    the comedic character Red Tornado, debuting in All-American Comics #20 (Nov 1940); Miss Fury,[19] debuting in the eponymous
    comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills on April 6, 1941; the Phantom Lady, introduced in Quality Comics Police
    Comics #1 (Aug. 1941); the Black Cat,[20][21] introduced in Harvey Comics' Pocket Comics #1 (also Aug. 1941); and the
    Black Canary, introduced in Flash Comics #86 (Aug. 1947) as a supporting character.[22] The most iconic comic book superheroine,
    who debuted during the Golden Age, is Wonder Woman.[23] Modeled from the myth of the Amazons of Greek mythology, she
    was created by psychologist William Moulton Marston, with help and inspiration from his wife Elizabeth and their mutual
    lover Olive Byrne.[24][25] Wonder Woman's first appearance was in All Star Comics #8 (Dec. 1941), published by All-American
    Publications, one of two companies that would merge to form DC Comics in 1944. 1950s[edit] In 1952, Osamu Tezuka's manga
    Tetsuwan Atom (more popularly known in the west as Astro Boy) was published. The series focused upon a robot boy built
    by a scientist to replace his deceased son. Being built from an incomplete robot originally intended for military purposes
    Astro Boy possessed amazing powers such as flight through thrusters in his feet and the incredible mechanical strength
    of his limbs. The 1950s saw the Silver Age of Comics. During this era DC introduced the likes of Batwoman in 1956, Supergirl,
    Miss Arrowette, and Bat-Girl; all female derivatives of established male <strong>superhero</strong>. 1958 saw the debut
    of superhero Moonlight Mask on Japanese television. 1960s[edit] The Marvel Comics teams of the early 1960s typically
    included at least one (and often the only) female member, much like DC's flagship superhero team the Justice League of
    America (whose initial roster included Wonder Woman as the token female); examples include the Fantastic Four's Invisible
    Girl, the X-Men's Jean Grey (originally known as Marvel Girl), the Avengers' Wasp, and the Brotherhood of Mutants' Scarlet
    Witch (who later joined the Avengers). In 1963, Astro Boy was adapted into a highly influential anime television series.
    Phantom Agents in 1964 focused on ninjas working for the Japanese government and would be the foundation for Sentai-type
    series. 1966 saw the debut of sci-fi/horror series Ultra Q created by Eiji Tsuburaya this would eventually lead on to
    the sequel Ultraman, spawning a successful franchise focused upon the Giant Hero subgenre where the <strong>superhero</strong>    would be as big as giant monsters (Kaiju) that they fought. 1970s[edit] In 1972, the Science Ninja Team Gatchaman anime
    debuted, which built upon the superhero team idea of the live-action Phantom Agents as well as introducing different
    colors for team members and special vehicles to support them, said vehicles could also combine into a larger one. Another
    important event was the debut of Mazinger Z by Go Nagai, creating the Super Robot genre. Go Nagai also wrote the manga
    Cutey Honey in 1973, although the Magical Girl genre already existed, Nagai's manga introduced Transformation sequences
    that would become a staple of Magical Girl media. The 1970s would see more anti-heroes introduced into Superhero fiction
    such examples included the debut of Shotaro Ishinomori's Skull Man in 1970, Go Nagai's Devilman in 1972 and Gerry Conway
    and John Romita's Punisher in 1974. The dark Skull Man manga would later get a television adaptation and underwent drastic
    changes. The protagonist was redesigned resemble a grasshopper, becoming the renowned first masked hero of the Kamen
    Rider series. Kamen Rider is a motorcycle riding hero in an insect-like costume, who shouts Henshin (Transform) to don
    his costume and gain superhuman powers. The ideas of second-wave feminism, which spread through the 1960s into the 1970s,
    greatly influenced the way comic book companies would depict as well as market their female characters: Wonder Woman
    was for a time revamped as a mod-dressing martial artist directly inspired by the Emma Peel character from the British
    television series The Avengers (no relation to the superhero team of the same name),[26] but later reverted to Marston's
    original concept after the editors of Ms. magazine publicly disapproved of the character being depowered and without
    her traditional costume;[27] Supergirl was moved from being a secondary feature on Action Comics to headline Adventure
    Comics in 1969; the Lady Liberators appeared in an issue of The Avengers as a group of mind-controlled superheroines
    led by Valkyrie (actually a disguised supervillainess) and were meant to be a caricatured parody of feminist activists;[28]
    and Jean Grey became the embodiment of a cosmic being known as the Phoenix Force with seemingly unlimited power in the
    late 1970s, a stark contrast from her depiction as the weakest member of her team a decade ago. Both major publishers
    began introducing new superheroines with a more distinct feminist theme as part of their origin stories or character
    development. Examples include Big Barda, Power Girl, and the Huntress by DC comics; and from Marvel, the second Black
    Widow, Shanna the She-Devil, and The Cat.[29] Female supporting characters who were successful professionals or hold
    positions of authority in their own right also debuted in the pages of several popular superhero titles from the late
    1950s onward: Hal Jordan's love interest Carol Ferris was introduced as the Vice-President of Ferris Aircraft and later
    took over the company from her father; Medusa, who was first introduced in the Fantastic Four series, is a member of
    the Inhuman Royal Family and a prominent statesperson within her people's quasi-feudal society; and Carol Danvers, a
    decorated officer in the United States Air Force who would become a costumed superhero herself years later. In 1975 Shotaro
    Ishinomori's Himitsu Sentai Gorenger debuted on what is now TV Asahi, it brought the concepts of multi-colored teams
    and supporting vehicles that debuted in Gatchaman into live-action. In 1978, Toei adapted Spider-Man into a live-action
    series. In this continuity, Spider-Man had a vehicle called Marveller that could transform into a giant and powerful
    robot called Leopardon, this idea would be carried over to Toei's Battle Fever J and now multi-colored teams not only
    had support vehicles but giant robots to fight giant monsters with. 1980s onwards[edit] In subsequent decades, popular
    characters like Dazzler, She-Hulk, Elektra, Catwoman, Witchblade, Spider-Girl, Batgirl and the Birds of Prey became stars
    of long-running eponymous titles. Female characters began assuming leadership roles in many ensemble superhero teams;
    the Uncanny X-Men series and its related spin-off titles in particular have included many female characters in pivotal
    roles since the 1970s.[30] Volume 4 of the X-Men comic book series featured an all-female team as part of the Marvel
    NOW! branding initiative in 2013.[31] Superpowered female characters like Buffy the Vampire Slayer[32] and Darna[33][34]
    have a tremendous influence on popular culture in their respective countries of origin. With more and more anime, manga
    and Tokusatsu being translated or adapted, western audiences were beginning to experience the Japanese styles of superhero
    fiction more than they were able to before. Saban's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, an adaptation of Zyuranger created
    a multimedia franchise that used footage from Super Sentai.[35] Internationally, the Japanese comic book character, Sailor
    Moon, is recognized as one of the most important and popular female <strong>superhero</strong> ever created.[36][37][38][39][40]

<h5> Common Traits </h5>
<p>
    Many superhero characters display the following traits: Extraordinary powers or abilities. Superhero powers vary widely;
    superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters
    like Batman, Mockingbird, the Phantom and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as
    martial arts, espionage techniques, and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical
    weapons or technology, such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed
    by Green Arrow and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon or device
    (e.g. Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating hammer, and Wolverine's
    adamantium claws). A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without
    expectation of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons. Publisher
    Standard Comics' America's Best Comics vol. 3, #1 (issue #7; Oct. 1943), a typical example of a World War II-era Golden
    Age comic, featuring <strong>superhero</strong> battling contemporaneous, cartoon-stereotype depictions of the three
    Axis powers leaders. Cover art by Alex Schomburg. A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man),
    an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder Woman), a childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or
    a strong belief in justice and humanitarian service (e.g. Superman). A secret identity that protects the superhero's
    friends and family from becoming targets of his or her enemies, such as Clark Kent (Superman), or to protect themselves
    from getting arrested by the police, like Spider-Man, although many <strong>superhero</strong> have a confidant (usually
    a friend or relative who has been sworn to secrecy). Most <strong>superhero</strong> use a descriptive or metaphoric
    code name for their public deeds. However, there are also rare ones whose true identities are common public knowledge,
    even with a costumed identity (e.g. Iron Man and Captain America). A distinctive costume, often used to conceal the secret
    identity (see Common costume features). An underlying motif or theme that affects the hero's name, costume, personal
    effects, and other aspects of his or her character (e.g. Batman wears a bat-inspired costume, uses bat-themed equipment,
    and operates at night; Spider-Man can project artificial webbing from wrist-mounted web shooting gadgets, has a spider
    web pattern on his costume, and other spider-like abilities). A supporting cast of recurring characters, including the
    hero's friends, co-workers or love interests, who may or may not know of the superhero's secret identity. Often the hero's
    personal relationships are complicated by this dual life, a common theme in Batman, Spider-Man and Superman stories in
    particular. A rogues gallery consisting of enemies that he/she fights repeatedly. In some cases <strong>superhero</strong>    begin by fighting run-of-the-mill criminals before supervillains surface in their respective story lines. In many cases
    the hero is in part responsible for the appearance of these supervillains (the Scorpion was created as the perfect enemy
    to defeat Spider-Man; the Sentinels were designed to hunt mutants who often represent the protagonists of Marvel stories;
    and characters in Batman's comics often accuse him of inadvertently creating the villains he fights). Often <strong>superhero</strong>    have a recurring archenemy who is especially threatening, or a nemesis who is depicted as a doppelganger or foil (e.g.
    Wolverine is outmatched physically by Sabretooth, who embraces his savage instincts while the former attempts to suppress
    his; the psychopathic Reverse-Flash's costume and abilities are very similar to the Flash's; the Joker is flamboyant
    and colorful in contrast to the moody, grim Batman. Magneto is restless and hostile in contrast to the calm and peaceful
    Professor X.) Independent wealth (e.g. Batman's family fortune, the X-Men's patron Professor X, Iron Man's father's weapon
    and technology company) or an occupation that allows for minimal supervision (e.g. Spider-Man's civilian job as a freelance
    photographer). A backstory that explains the circumstances by which the character acquired his or her abilities as well
    as his or her motivation for becoming a superhero. Many origin stories involve tragic elements or freak accidents that
    result in the development of the hero's abilities. Normal, human flaws like extravagance (Tony Stark), aggression (Wolverine)
    or a dysfunctional family (very common: e.g. Batman, Magneto). Many <strong>superhero</strong> work independently. However,
    there are also many superhero teams. Some, such as the Fantastic Four, DNAgents, and the X-Men, have common origins and
    usually operate as a group. Some are families in which the parents and kids have superpowers, like The Incredibles. Others,
    such as DC Comics’s Justice League and Marvel’s Avengers, are "all-star" groups consisting of heroes with separate origins
    who also operate individually, yet will team up to confront larger threats. The shared setting or "universes" of Marvel,
    DC and other publishers also allow for regular superhero crossover team-ups. Some <strong>superhero</strong>, especially
    those introduced in the 1940s, work with a young sidekick (e.g. Batman and Robin, Captain America and Bucky). This has
    become less common since more sophisticated writing and older audiences have lessened the need for characters who specifically
    appeal to child readers. Sidekicks are seen as a separate classification of <strong>superhero</strong>. Although superhero
    fiction is considered a form of fantasy/adventure, it crosses into many genres. Some superhero franchises resemble crime
    fiction (e.g. Batman, Spider-Man, Daredevil), horror fiction (e.g. Hellboy, The Spectre), paranoid fiction (e.g. Watchmen,[41]
    Marvelman/Miracleman), and conventional science fiction (e.g. Green Lantern, Guardians of the Galaxy). Many of the earliest
    <strong>superhero</strong>, such as the Sandman and the Clock, were rooted in the pulp fiction of their predecessors.
    Within their own fictional universes, public perception of <strong>superhero</strong> varies greatly. Some, like Superman
    and the Fantastic Four, are adored and seen as important civic leaders or even celebrities. Others, like Hulk, Spider-Man
    and the characters of Watchmen, are met with public skepticism or outright hostility. A few, such as the X-Men and Doom
    Patrol, defend a populace that almost unanimously misunderstands and despises them.
